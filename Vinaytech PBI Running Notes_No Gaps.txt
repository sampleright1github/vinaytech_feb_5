===================================================================
1st Section in the SSBI [End-End BI] EXTRACTING DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES[ multiple data feeds]
====================================================================
Objective: 
How do we connect and bring data from multiple types of sources
[Files, Databases, Cubes, Cloud sources etc...]
a) Create a table dynamically at Power BI
b) Create a query using flat file [.txt]
c) Create a query using flat file [.csv--comma seperated value file]
d) Create a query using flat file [anonymous extension....vinay, .raghu etc...]
e) Getting data from Website [.html, .php, .aspx etc...]
f) Getting multiple files from a folder and merging files data  [appending]
    Protocol: Structure should match [ Name, data type, data type order, number of columns]
g) Getting data from PDF [normal page reading and table data reading]
h) Getting data from JSON file [ Java Structured Object Notation ]
	--Semi structured file, Easy to understand, Contain simple structure [attribute and property], extension [.json]
	--Web developers [themes, shapemap, Big Data etc...]
i) Generating tables / queries using Mashup and DAX languages



Table Visual Features:
a) Column by column data display [columnar visual]
b) Supports formating row and coumn wise [static formating and dynamic formatting]
c) No drilldown and drillup at table level
d) Shows Total section in the down.
e) If you want to show more rows [data display], then only one visual Table is helpful.






















j) Retrieving data from SQL Server Database [Table / View/ Procedure / Function]
k) Retrieving data from Azure SQL Database
l) Retrieving data from Tabular Cube database

What is flat file?
Any editor generated file is called as flat file.
Ex: Notepad, Wordpad, Vi [Unix] etc...

How many options you will find when we work with flatfile?

 When we work with flat file we will find three options 
a) Code page [language and characterset]
b) Data type detection [ identifying data type for the columns]
c) Delimiter [separators  Ex: comma, tab, pipe etc...]

If I select data type detection as entire dataset, what happens?
Performance will decrease, but you will get accurate data types.

When does system establish auto relationships?
The algorithms consider the below three protocols
a) Name b) Data type  c) Data Values

How do you see how much memory / cpu Power BI Desktop is occupying? [performance tip]
Go to Windows-->Task manager[ctrl+alt+del]-->Background processes and Services














EXTRACTION--> TRANSFORMATION--> MODELING--> SECURE-->VISULIZATION


I want to generate queries using Power BI Popular languages...

PBI uses two langs
a) Mashup:  
	Used for "Extract and Transform" operations
	"Fastest lang to implement transform operations"
	Available at Power Query Level
	
	Get data--Blank Query-->Power Query Area-->formula bar, =List.Numbers(200,10), Save 

b) DAX
	Used for "Modeling and Analysis"
	[Data Analysis Expressions]
	It is a functional / formula language
	Available at "Power View" level
	Modeling menu--> New table --> formula bar--> 
	Date Table=calendar(date(2021,01,01),date(2021,01,10))




====================================================================
Basic Features of Mashup...

	a) Similar to other languages, it has its own elements[identifier, keyword, operator, datatype,
		function, parameter etc...]
	b) It has hierarchy to work with operations [functions]: To classify business operations
	     ClassLibrary. Classes. Method(<arguments>)
	     SavingsAccount.Withdraw.ATMWithdraw()
	     SavingsAccount.Withdraw.CashCounter()
	c) No need to write any Mashup code in real-time [very rare]
	d) Most of the operations are graphical operations in mashup [right click / menu options]
	e) If you don't find required functionality, then we go for Own Code Writing in Mashup / R / Python.
	f) For each Query[set of cols], system generate a mashup script [ we can see in the Advanced Editor area] with steps starting from Source Reading to Till latest opertion.
	  [You can see the same Graphically at View Menu--> Query Settings]	

	Ex:
		let
			Source=from where we got it ,
			step1/variable1= Source + Respective operation,
			Step2/variable2=step1+ Respective Operation,

			....
			StepN/variableN=stepN-1+ Respective Operation

		in  < stepN/variableN>

	g) We can add steps  / modify steps [update/delete] in two ways
			1. Advanced editor coding   2. Query Settings--> Graphically 
=====================================================================
List: Single column of values [ can be converted to Table]
Query: Set of columns
Note:  SQL Query Terminology and Power BI Query Terminology are Different
--------
JSON: Java Structured Object Notation  [File extension is .json]
	Semi structued file [suitable for partial structured, unstructured, and structured data]
	Simple language
	Need to have understanding about properties and attributes.
-------
Extract Topic Pending:  a) Database Retrieval b) Cube database retrieval c) Azure Cloud data retrieval 
-------
Transformation: Power Query area


We need to use our Institute data [DWH data, which has dimension and fact terminology]

Dimension: Textual attribute [column which is not suitable for aggregate operations]
Dimension Table: Contains textual data [master table, primary key]

Fact: Measure: Calculated value / Aggregated value
Fact Table: Child Table : Contain two sections a) Dimension references b) Measures

When do we go for transformation?
a) Columns not properly available b) Need sorting on values c) Need filtering on values d) Grouping values
e) Transpose rows into columns f) Reverse rows g) Adding columns [sequntial /logical / conditional] etc...

Where we go to implement it?
Power Query Area [a)Home menu-->Transform Data    b)     While retrieving also we can go]

How do perform transformations in Power Query?
a) Built-in options [right click->properties] or Menu bar options b) Writing mashup code c) R and Python code
Note: If the existing Built-in functions not suitable, then go for Mashup or R or Python languages

How many places built-in transforms [graphical] available?
8 places [a) Queries b) Query c) Column d) Multi Column e) Filter f) Menu g) Steps h) R and Python]









Copy and Paste: 
		Legacy options [available in all Microsoft  applications]
		Here, it copies the query with all setps available
		It make changes independent to the query [ source changes it does not take]: Independent copy

Duplicate
		Mashup option [copy + Paste]
		Here, it copies the query with all setps available
		It make changes independent to the query [ source changes it does not take]

Reference

		Create a copy with source step only.
		It will take source changes. It creates dependent copy.

Enable Load:	It allows data loading. It is recommended if you want to use that query on the visual and also used for 
		data refresh from sources.
Refresh:		Getting Source data changes into Power BI is called as refresh. Refresh is of two types.
		a) Full refresh: Complete source data changes into Power BI. Available at Power Query.
		b) Incremental Refresh: Taking required data [required days/ weeks/ months....] into Power BI. Available at 
					Report View Level.





How many ways we can add columns to a Query?
5 ways of columns adding
a) Add Index column: 
	1.Sequential value adding [starting from 0/1/user defined]
	2.Realtime:  a) If you don't have a sequential number b) Surrogate key required [Dimensional Modeling]
b) Add Custom Column:
	1.To add a column based on logics or expressions
	2. To implement business logics, we use this column
c) Add column from Examples: [ Flashy column concept]
	1. To add a copy of the column  2. To add a column with built-in transforms [We need not write]
d) Add Conditional Column:
	1. Add a column by taking conditions and showing values based on condition
e) Invoke custom function
	1.It adds a column by invoking existing functions [user defined functions]
	Note: You must have functions created in your Queries area








What is function? When do we go for it?
Function take set of statements and performs an operation.
In all IT applications, function is the core element.
[C, C++, Java, .Net, Python, R etc...they have rich set of functions]
Programming level, we will create more and more, whereas GUI level, the functions are code behind and available as options.

How do we create functions in Power BI?
a) Mashup language b) Python and R languages c) Machine Learning Methods

Mashup Language features?
a) Similar other to languages it has identifier, data types, operators, functions etc... 
b) It follows hierarchy [ClassLibrary.Classes.Methods] Ex: SavingsAccount. WithDraw.Online/Cash/Card...
c) For each query, system creates a mashup script [this has all operations starting from source step...]
	Reading the mashup script:
	a) Starts with "let" and ends with "in" followed by last step/ variable
	b) Each step/variable contains previous step + operation 
	c) One step / variable seperated  to other using comma
	Note: Script contain multiple statements




Do we need to learn Mashup?
	Yes, basic understanding of mashup is required.
	Indetiled knowledge is required for those writing more and more functions and play with scripts.	

Can you give me syntax and one sample function in Mashup?
<function name>=(arguments)=>(body)
=(arg1 as Number, arg2 as Number)=>((arg1*10/100) + (arg2*20/100))

Append:

a) Follows set theory UNION ALL operation b) Combine rows from multiple tables
b) If structure is same, then it will do proper combining d) If structure does not match, it will add the columns seperately [which are not matched]
 
"null" Handling in Power Query?
Three ways
a) Replace "null" with user defined value  b) Fillup null values with First Not null value
c) Filldown null values with Last Not null value 










Group By:  a) Categorizes the data b) Support Aggregate Operations
	Ex: Creating an aggregate table 
	[location and mode wise sum of income, avg of income and count of students]
	Two real-time purposes in Power query:  a) Eliminating duplicates  b) Preparing aggregate table
Aggregate Table: The table which is having Group By, SUM, AVG, COUNT etc... calculated values

When do you use "Drilldown" in Power Query?
a) You want a particular column as a list
b) You don't want the parent query [parent overwritten]

When do you use "Add as New Query" in Power Query?
a) You want a particular column as a list
b) You want the parent query retained

Combining Columns: 
a) If there is at least one Textual column: You will find Merge option only [concatenating with delimiter]
b) If all are numeric columns: You will find a) Merge b) SUM [total of multiple cols] c) Product[Multiplication] 

Filtering rows: 
a) Based on data type filter take place b) Sorting and filtering possible c) FIltering again 1.Basic 2. Advanced

Reverse rows: Down rows up and up rows down [top being lowest]

	      Note: This is different from Ascending and Descending order

Transpose rows: Rows into columns and columns into rows

Denormalized data adv and disadv: 
		[one or more columns having history / redundancy].
		Adv: As you have history of rows, you can analyze and perform calculations

		Disadv: More memory [because many redundant rows]

Normaized Data adv and DIsadv: [Columns not having redundancy / no history]
		Adv: Less memory
		Disadv: Difficult to analyze

Pivoting:		Converting denormalized to normalized format [row to columns]

Unpivoting:	Converting Normalized to denormalized [columns to rows]






What is merging in Power Query?
Coditional join between multiple queries and bring columns.
It has 6 join operations [inner, left outer, right outer, full outer, left anti, right anti

How many types of search we have in merge?
a) Exact match search b) Fuzzy search [ similarity search]

Multiple same structured queris combining is APPEND.  Equavalent in SQL: UNION ALL
Multiple queries comibing column wise is MERGE. Equvalent in SQL: JOINS
Extact Match in Merge: Normal Merge: JOINS in SQL
Similarity match in merge: FUZZY MATCH:  LIKE OPERATOR with Wild Card Characters (%, _) in Joins




What is datatype? Why do we require?
Datatype talks about the type of data you are using for storage.
Based on this the application storage will be.
Note: You can apply transforms / filtering operations based on datatypes only.
	Ex: Numeric columns [indication: 123, whole number]: Numerical Calculations
	      String Columns [indication: abc, Text]: Textual Calculations
	     Date Columns [indication: calendar symbol, Date]: Date Calculations
	    Decimal Values [indication:1.2, Decimal or Fixed Decimal]: Decimal calculations 



Parse: Compile the given textual value, split the cell value into column values.
	a) JSON Parse: JSON input into columns
	b) XML Parse: XML input into columns
Data Quality Options:  a) Column quality b) Column Distribution c) Column Profile









What is Data type?
Type of data assigned to the column.
What is the advnatage of data type?
Two advantages with appropriate datatype
a)To reduce unnecessary data storage b) To apply supportive operations c)Position or placement of value
POWER BI important data types?
Wholenumber(123), Decimal(1.2), Date(calendar symbol), Boolean, Time, Timezone etc...
What is the advantage of knowing these?
Based on data type only you can implement operations.
Ex: Numeric column--numeric operations
      String column--textual operations
      Date column--Date operations [Time operations]
Note: Numerics always from right to left...textual values always from left to right

C / c++/ .Net / Java etc...lang: integer,decimal, string
SQL: Smallint, int, bigint,decimal, float,char, varchar
Power BI: whole number, decimal, fixed decimal, text

CREATE AN AGGREGATE TABLE WHICH SHOWS LOCATION AND MODE WISE SUM OF DISCOUNT_FEE,AVG OF DISCOUNT_FEE,
COUNT OF STUDENTS



How many split options available?
a) By delimiter:  
	a) vinay, kumar :  After split based on comma --> Column1: vinay  Column2: kumar
	b) ramesh@gmail.com--> ramesh     gmail.com-->split based on delimiter @
b) By Number of Characters:
	Ex: 
	a) I need in each column 5 chars only.   Numer of characters to split is : 5
	 b) I have data like this...split it...
	    HYDTS.
                     KHAMMAMTS.
                     WarangalTS.

	    Numer of characters: 3                      once, as far right as possible

	 c) I have data like this...split it...
	    .TSHYD
                     .TSKHAMMAM
                     .TSWarangal

	    Numer of characters: 3                     once, as far left as possible

c) By Positions: Take a number and split into two parts
	Ex: vinay kumar, by position: 3                Output: Column1: vin   column2: ay kumar
c)By lower to upper
	Ex: abcMNO.... column1: abc  column2:MNO
d) By upper to lower
	Ex: MNOabc....column1: MNO  column2: abc
e) By Digit to Non Digit
	Ex: 123abc...column1: 123  column2: abc
f) By Non digit to digit
	Ex: abc123....column1: abc   column2: 123





                     







What is refresh? How many mechanisms available?

Getting source data changes into Power BI report is called as refresh.

There are two types 
a) Full refresh [complete source data refresh]   b) Incremental refresh [only required days data refresh]

Taking the steps to the SQL Database and Performing operations at database to bring data.
The steps taken at Database comes under query folding [steps folding].
Ex: There are 20 steps in a query, 15 possible at database level, 5 exclusively at Power Query Mashup level.
In this situation, implement 15 at database [query folding] and 5 at Power Query

Performance Tip: Do the operations at database level and bring the data using customized query.






Extract--> Transform Process Completed.  Next is Modeling
Modeling at Power View   a) Filed / Dataset Properties        b) Data Model Properties  c) Modeling Menu

Parsing: 
It will cosider the JSON / XML as textual data and split into column values.

Recent Sources: 
Single Line:The data sources used in all reports of current machine
Adv: Directly you can connect to the source without much effort.

Data Source Settings:

Single Line: Displays current source path / server settings
Adv: a) You can view b) You can change the path / server settings [ Multiple environments (dev, test, prod)]

What is network path ? How is it advantage?

Network path helps to connect to machine with machine name and folder name.

Remote paths [ remote servers connected using this]
Syn: \\computername or ip \foldername         Ex: \\vinaytech\Testing_Envi


What is PBIDs extension?
This is data source extension which is useful to quickly connect to the source.

What is Global settings?
The settings used in multiple desktop documents in the same machine







What is parameter?
User interaction storage variable.
What is the usage of parameter?
a) User inetraction b) Environment connections [connection strings]
How many types of parameters we have?
a) Any: Support user interaction by entering value
b) List: Static list of values in the drop down for user selection
c)  Query: Dynamic list of values in the dropdown for user selection
How do we operate parameters?
a) Create it b) Filter it at Query-->Field level
User Passing values--> Parameters--> Query---> Visual
Ex: I want a report which has three values user interaction [stdid, locid and courseid]

What is Cascading parameter?
One parameter output is input to another parameter.
Ex: If we select country, showing state, if we select state, showing district etc...
Country-->State-->District-->Mandal etc...
Note: This concept is not available in PBI 
Are the parameters flexible to customers?
Not flexible and these are only at Power BI Desktop.
Hence we go fo Filters, Slicers in older projects, latest projects What-If parameter topic. 

How do we add steps in between for a query?
Two ways a) Steps-->right click-->Insert step after    b) Go to advanced editor--> Add step using code

How do we get first 6 setps and construct a query from the parent query which is having 15 steps?
Step--> right click--> Extract Previous...

a) Getting Objects using import mode [by selecting]--completed
b) Getting Objects using direct query mode [by selecting]--completed
c) Generating query by writing a custom SQL (select) query [either of the modes]
d) Generating query by getting data from procedure
e) Import Mode: Which brings structure +data [till 1 GB it is effective to perform transforms, calculations and visuals show]
f) Direct Quey : Which brings only structure [for more volumes of data and to get fresh data always from the source]
g) Mixed Mode: import +direct query
h) Converting from Direct Query/ Mixed Mode to Import--> Simple process--> right click switch mode and convert
i) Converting from Import/ Mixed mode to Direct query--> Complex process--> A separate process required


















When do we use change data source settings [file path / database (normal/cube) / cloud source path]?
a) Report has to be tested / viewed with multiple environments data
b) Reports has be scheduled with multiple environments [production environment]



Data Display Visuals: [Card, Multirowcard, Table, Matrix]

Card Visual: Single Value display visual
Multirow card visual: Multiple values [cards] in a row display visual
Table Visual: Multi column visual [columnar visual]

==================================================================
1st Section : Data Extraction from Multiple Sources
==================================================================
Getting Data from Faltfile, Excel, Csv, Json, Mashup Expression, DAX Expression, SQL Server Database
 [Table, View, Function, Procedure]

Note: SSAS Tabular Cube and Azure SQL Database [Video]

==================================================================
2nd Section : Data Transformation on Excel file data and SQL Server Tables
==================================================================
Transforms at 8 places [Queries, Query, Field, Multiple Fields, Filter, Menu, Steps, R, Python, and AI]

==================================================================
3rd Section in Reporting [Modeling] : Relationships and data dependencies establishment
Extract--> Transform--> Modeling
==================================================================
There are three places we need to focuss
a) Dataset properties 
	1. Query Properties [Date Table Consideration, Incremental Refresh /Refresh, Hide, Expand etc...]
	2. Field Properties [Group, Hierarchy, Drillthrough etc...]
	3. New Measure, New Column, New Table etc...
b) Data Model relationships 
	1. Denormalized Model Relationships [1:1,1:Many,Many: Many]
	2. Fact Table [Summarized Table, Aggregated Table], Dimension Table [Textual Table]
	3. Star Schema, Snow Flake Schema, Galaxy Scheme, Mixed Schema etc...
	4. Single and Bidirectional relationship
	5. Active and Inactive relationships
	6. Surrogate Key and Role Playing Dimensions
	7. Query Additional Settings
	8. Field Additional Settings [Display Folder, Visibility etc...]

C) Modeling Menu-->Important Modeling Measures using DAX [to reduce creating unnecessary measures multiple times]


What is refresh? How many mechanisms available?
Getting source data changes into Power BI report is called as refresh.
There are two types 
a) Full refresh [complete source data refresh]   b) Incremental refresh [only required days data refresh]

How PBI Desktop and PBI Cloud refresh different for On-Premises sources?
PBI Desktop Report Refresh:  On Premises  source--> Power BI Desktop
PBI Service Report Refresh: On-Premise source--> Gateway---> Power BI Report at Service

Mark as Date Table: It will consider a table as date table, so that all date calculations you can apply quickly.

Note: The specified date column should have unique values and no gaps in them

Hierarchy: 
	Contain multiple levels and members. Minimum two levels required. Advantage [to perform drilldown and drillup 	analysis with easy aggregate values show]. Hierarchies support dimension values[textual values].
	Ex: Location Hierarchy: Country-->State--> Dist-->Mandal etc...
    	  Year Hierarchy: Year--> Semister / Half Year--> Qtr--> Month--> Fort Night--> Week-->Day
Groups:    Categorize data. 
	Two types of groups [a) Physical Group at Power Query b) Logical Group at Power View]
	Logical groups:
	a)List Group: List of values grouping [For all data type columns]
	b)Bin Group: Based on size or Count we will create [ For Numerics and Dates]
	Note: Binsize indicate one group to another group value difference, count indicate number of groups.
	           We can create any number of logical groups.	

Group: Categorizes the data and also support aggregate operations.
Power Query: Physical Group: Group + Aggregate Values [compulsary]
Power View: Logical Group: Groups only [ List (numeric, string, date), Bin [Numerics, Date]]

What is the difference between Bin size and Count?
Size is the group value difference, count is the number of groups.
3000
6000
9000
12000
15000
bin count :3, size decided by the system
3000+6000   9000+12000  15000










DAX Measures Creation:

DAX: Data Analysis Expressions

Data Modeling and Analysis langauge / Functional Lang / Formula Lang.
===================================================
Similar to other langs it has many elements, but most imp elements are identifiers, operators, keywords etc...
functions
=============================================================================
9 categories of functions...[Date, Parent & Child, Time Intelligence, Filter, Math & Trig, Statistical, Information, Logical etc...]
=============================================================================

Current Year Sales, Previous Year Sales, Two Years Back Sales, Next Year, Next Two Years Sales,
Growth, Growth Percentage also.... I want to write calculations and place in the table...

Current: 30000   Last year=20000

Growth=current-last=30000-20000=10000
Growth Percenatge=Growth/ Lastyear * 100
		10000/20000  * 100=1/2 * 100=50%


Measure: Single value result component
New Column: Multiple values result component
New Table: Multiple columns result component

Measure : Is a calculated value / aggregate result value
Sum/Average/Count/Max/Min will do complete columnwise operation [all values participated].Single Arg.
Calculate: Perform calculations based on expression. Two arguments needed.

Parent Measure:

Sum DF=Sum(Factpayments [Discount Fee])
Avg DF=Average(Factpayments[Discount Fee])
Count Std=Count(Factpayments[StudentID])

Dependent Measures:

Last Year Sales=calculate([Sum DF],previousyear(DimDate[Date]))
Two Years Back DF=calculate([Sum Df], previousyear(previousyear(DimDate[Date]))--lengthy way
Two Years Back DF 1=Calculate([Sum DF], parallelperiod(Dimdate[date],-2,year))--shortcut
Previous N Years DF=Calculate([Sum DF], parallelperiod(Dimdate[date],-N,year))--shortcut

Next Year Sales=calculate([Sum DF],Nextyear(DimDate[Date]))
Two Next Years DF=calculate([Sum Df], Nextyear(nextyear(DimDate[Date]))--lengthy way

Two Next Years  DF 1=Calculate([Sum DF], parallelperiod(Dimdate[date],2,year))--shortcut
Next N Years DF=Calculate([Sum DF], parallelperiod(Dimdate[date],N,year))--shortcut

Sub Dependent Measures

Growth=[Sum DF]-[Last Year Sales]
Growth Percentage= Divide(Growth, [Last Year DF) * 100

Current : 30000 Last Year:20000
Growth=30000-20000=10000
Growth Percentage=10000/20000 * 100=1/2*100=50%




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without going to model (using DAX) implementing Bidirectional relationship and calculations

Using CROSSFILTER function

Count of courses
=calculate(DISTINCTCOUNT(DimCourse[CourseID]),crossfilter(FactPayments[CourseID],DimCourse[CourseID],both))


Without going to model (using DAX) providing dynamic / runtime  relationship and calculations
Using USERELATIONSHIP
Enquiry Date based DF = CALCULATE(sum(FactPayments[Discount_Fee]),USERELATIONSHIP(FactPayments[Enquiry_Date],DimDate[Date]))






Reuse the data model across team[s]:

a) Share the pbix file [Normal]
b) Publish to cloud and ask team to use it [recommended]
c) Create a template and share [pbit creation and it has only structure]
d) Create a Dataflow at cloud service and use it

How do we use Power BI Template?
a) Open Power BI Desktop, File Menu--> Import --> Template--> Specify the file path
b) Go to Data Source Settings, specify the proper file path [to bring the data]
c) Refresh Data
d) Save Report

Working on Visuals
----------------------
Visual: A component which shows data or graphical incuded data.

Visual Types:
		a) Field Visual
			1.Data Display Visual [Card, Multi Row Card, Table, Matrix]

			2. Data + Graphical information visual 
				a) Simple Graphical [KPI, Gauge etc...]
				b) MOre Graphical [Charts, Maps etc...]

		b) No Field visual
				Buttons, Images, Shapes etc...


a) Report prepation process in real-time [Documents, important settings], Input and Output Docs
b) Created a page with all required settings
	1. Page Settings  2. Page View Settings 3. Themes
c) I created a page with Image [explained format options], Textbox, Line, and buttons
	QA Button: a) Control + Enter required  b) Dialogue box opened c) User colors, formations not possible
	QA Visual: a) Seperate Visual b) User colors, formation possible

Bookmark: User interested area / snapshot of the visual or page
	  Two places we will create	a) PBI Desktop Level [developers created for customers]
				b) Service Level [Customers create]

d) Bookmark action to go to respective bookmark page
e) Page navigation action to go to respective page
f) Data Display Visuals:

	Card: Single value display [A column with aggregation / Measure (which is claready created) ]
	Multi row card: Multiple values in a row display
	Table Visual: Columnar visual. Column by column operation [data show, data formating etc...]. Total row added.
		     No Drilldown and No Drill up.  For more rows show table is suitable visual.
	Matrix Visual: Cross tab reporting visual [rows vs columns aggregate values show]. Less rows show. Supports
			Drilldown and Drill up.



g) Filters: 	Static data filtering[dynamic data filter is slicer]. Four types of filters.
	Visual Filter: Respective visual filtered[ Options: Basic, Advanced, TopN]
	Page Filter: Respective page filtered (all visuals in the page filtered) [ Options: Basic, Advanced]
	Report Filter: All pages in the report filtered [Options: Basic, Advanced]
	Drill through filter: Two types
			a) Single report drill through: One page to another page in the same report
			b) Cross report drill through: One page one report to another page in another report

h) Slicers: Dynamic user interaction visual.  It shows the visual data in List, Dropdown, Between and, Greater than or equals or
	less than or equals. For numeric and date[all options], string[list and dropdown]. Vertical [default] and horizontal 		orientation [button format] available. Slicer support values and hierarchies.
	Note: Before horizontal orientation, we used to go for Chiclet slicer. Before hierachies in the slicer, we used to go for
	          Hierarchy Slicer.
   Sync Slicing: If you need a common slicer in multiple pages with data slicing common in all pages, you need sync slicer.


i) KPI:	Key Performance Indicator. Talks about Current Vs Target. Simple cute visual.
j) Gauge: Rounded 180 degree shape. KPI+ Min value+Max Value. Litte more measures taking visual.


		
	






What is Z order?
WHen you have multple visuals, the way you want to load or appear is called as z-order
[select order ]

Charts:  [For textual info against numerical values(minimum one textual and one measurable value is compulsary]
	Multi field visual with multiple values show graphically. Charts designed for four types of operations
	a) Distribution b) Comparison c) Composition d) Relationship
	Distribution: With in the min category distributing sub categories
	Comparing: One value comparing to other value
	Composition: Combination of all parts / slices into 100%
	Relationship: How multiple measures related for category of textual values
	Note: There are different types of charts for different purposes
Stacked: Distributed
Clustered: Grouped [individual values group]
Bar: Comparison
100%--> Composition

Practice the below: a) Parent with multiple levels b) Child with multiple levels c) Values d) Tool tip additional column
		e) Small multiple [bar charts]

Row Chart: Depending on the number of values at row ...we prefer this
Column chart: Depending on the number of values at column... we prefer this

Stacked Bar: Distributed+ Comparison[row wise]
Stacked column: Distributed + Comparison [column wise]

Clustered Bar: Individual Group+ Comparison [row wise]
Clusterd Column:Individual Group+ Comparison  [column wise]

100%Stacked Bar: Composition+ Distribution+ Comparison [row wise]
100% Stacked Column: Composition + Distribution + Comparison [column wise]

Pie Chart: a) Rounded shape chart b) All values composition as 100% c) Limited categories show d) Displays in Slices
Donut Chart: a) Rounded shape chart b) All values composition as 100% c) Limited categories show d) Displays in Slices
		e) It has inner radius f) If inner radius is 0, then it is Pie chart.

Line Chart: Trend Analysis [ Time based / Category Based]

Area Chart: Area filling and overlapping areas

Mixed Charts:

Line and Clustered Column Chart: Trend Analysis [One measure]+ Individual values group+ Comparison [one measure]
Line and Stacked Column Chart: Trend Analysis[One measure]+ Distribution+ Comparison[One measure]

Funnel Chart:  
a) Top down analysis  b) Top one considered as 100%  c) Remaining validated based on top and previous

Waterfall chart:
a) Positive and negative values show b) Up and Down values show  c) Based on the green or red bar the profit or loss identification will be

Scatter Chart: Relationship Chart
a) Two Axis need two measures b) Category values compared againt to them c) Also has Play axis
d) Display the relationship in the form of bubbles and their sizes

Note: Except scatter chart, rest all charts take one measure in one axis (either X or Y)

KPI/ Gauge: For one Indicator analysis
Charts: Multiple field values [textual and measurable] analysis
Bullet Chart: One column of values against indicators analysis. Custom Visual.



Maps: To generate geo spatial maps. It takes location details or longitude and Latitude.
           Support cross filtering, highlighting and slicing. Four major types of built-in maps.
	There are four map visuals

	a) Map [ Bubble map, Bing Map]:2013
	b) Filled Map [Area filling map, Bing Map]:2015
	c) Shape Map [Own Shape Map, Color saturations to control business values]:2019 begining
	d) ArcGis Map [Complex map with many layers and features… This is from ESRI organization]:2020 

	Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System

	Note: Heatmap will generate a map by exposing the business values in the form of heat presentation.
	          This is different from bubble size and has its' own significance.
		Ex: I want to show more virus effected areas...then show heat than bubbles with sizes
	
	When do we use Longitude and Latitude?
	If you don't find location names and accurate points to be presented, then longitude and latitude helpful.
	Ex:
	You don't know locations on top of sky / under sea water
	In a location (hyd-ameerpet), want to locate Vinaytech, Power BI Tech instututes exactly...



AI Visuals:
	a) Decomposition Tree: It will divide the value into categories mentioned. Multiple level values we can derive.
			      Advantage is how we got the value and its inner elements we can identify.

	b) Key Influencer: Displays the category which influences most [decrease/ increase].

R and Python:
	R is statistical language. Python is General Purpose programming language[multiple operations].

	These languages used at Power Query [Transformtions] and Power View level [visuals generation].
	To use them to construct visuals
	a) Download and Install software [File menu-->options and settings--> R Scripting / Python Scripting]
	b) Download required Libraries, Classes and Methods [which you use in the scripting]
	c) Drag and Drop R/ Python visual
	d) Copy and Paste the Code in the Script Design Area
	e) Run the code
